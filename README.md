# RedYoshiBot
Discord bot used in the [CTGP-7 discord server](http://discord.gg/0uTPwYv3SPQww54l).
This bot is written with all the channel ids hardcoded to the CTGP-7 server channels, if you want to use this bot in your own server you'll need to change those. It is also designed to be run on a raspberry pi, that's why the shutdown code looks so weird.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.5
- [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)

## Credits
- Friend code system based on [Kurisu Bot](https://github.com/ihaveamac/Kurisu).
