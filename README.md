# RedYoshiBot
Discord bot used in the [CTGP-7 discord server](http://discord.gg/0uTPwYv3SPQww54l).
This bot is written with all the channel ids hardcoded to the server channels. If you want to use this bot in your own server you'll need to change those. The bot is designed to be run on a raspberry pi, that's why the shutdown code looks so weird.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.5
- [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)

## Credits
- Friend code system based on [Kurisu Bot](https://github.com/ihaveamac/Kurisu).
